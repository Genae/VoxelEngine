If you don't want to manually harvest the farm anymore you can upgrade it to a cattle farm by placing a fehu rune next to it.\nCattle is generating a steady amount of income without requiring any maintenance.\nAlternatively the wheat farm can be upgraded to a wine farm by placing a ingwaz rune next to it.\nThat makes the farm more profitable, however it grows slower and has to be harvested manually still.",
