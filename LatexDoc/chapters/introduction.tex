\chapter{Introduction}

We go back to the year 300 B.C., the peak of Celtic culture. Its influence extends across central Europe and the modern British Isles, where it is most present today. The conflict between the Celts and the Romans intensifies when the Romans try to push their influence northwards more and more.\\
This is where our game starts. The player has to defend wave after wave of incoming enemies and repel the romans while developing his own village. Who will come out on top? The giant organized roman empire or the naturalistic Celts with exceeding knowledge in ancient runes?
